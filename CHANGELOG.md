# Changelog

## Unreleased

## v0.3.5

- Fix empty Claude Code / OpenAI replies when the Go gateway puts the answer in `reasoning_content` (#37635): promote to `content`/`text` when thinking is not requested, and fall back to a text block if a thinking-only stream would otherwise end empty.
- Make `/v1/messages` thinking opt-in (`thinking.type=enabled`) instead of defaulting to keeping reasoning.
